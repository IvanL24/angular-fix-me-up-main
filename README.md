# angular-fix-me-up-main
 Code assessment using Angular and Next

 TODOs:
 1 the header (footer) needs to run flush to the top (bottom) and sides
 2 We've setup these routes and have them on the page but they aren't working
 3 Use Semantic HTML properly, what's wrong with this usage of main
 4 Our header and footer are suppose to fill the full width of the page and sit flush to the top / bottom e.g. no whitespace around the header / footer
 5 Fixing one thing may break other things, but sometimes it has to be done
 6 Angular ngFor, refactor, and bonus points
 7 Accessibility, table markup, form control
 8 route to detail view
 9 Topics in this file: Angular Unit Testing w/ Jest
 10 this test isn't doing anything atm, how can we make it more meaningful?
 10 Asynchronous Programming (RxJS)
 11 The Last Link is only suppose to be offset from the side of the screen by 20px, what can we do to fix this
 12 something's off with this include
 13 Angular (NX) Architecture
 14 fix the deprecation

 notes:
 -- Testing: not sure how to do it, ask about it
 -- scss deprecation: does not show any deprecation, did i miss something?
 -- transfers page: is there a hidden file that contains transactions for each id of do I just display details from account overview by id?
 -- links: why is  only the  last link that has an offset?
 -- @include link: are we supposed to use @use of @import? @import fixed some of the problem while @use does not.
 
 need help with:
 -- other ways to get id for account details page.
 -- create a method to check if id exists in array of objects.

 to be fixed:
 -- id retrieval for transfer page
